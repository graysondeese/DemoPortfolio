This project required me to build a portfolio from scratch using Bootstrap.
We were given screenshots of multiple pages and told to make our project look as close to the pictures as possible, but we were allowed to play with the colors and styling a little bit. 
This screenshots of the original project that I had to make my project match are in the "Assets/Images" folder.
I think I did a pretty good job. 
As a bonus we were allowed to create a sticky footer. This took me a fair amount of time but I finally got it the way I wanted.
